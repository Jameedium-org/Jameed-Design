## The Brandmark Parts:

The JameediumÂ© brandmark has 2 main parts: `the arrows` and `the circle`.

```hint|warning
**Warning:** don't try to recreate the logo or any parts of it nor edit them. If you need the mark it is provided in the [download](/downloads/logo) section of this guideline.
```

### The Arrows:
Each `arrow` is the result of subtracting two isosceles triangles ( bigger - smaller ) that have the same base and with `JMG Blue` [fill color](/colors/shades).

plain: true

```

were `x = 74.55`, and `y = 110.5`.

then the seconed `arrow` is just a mirrored version of the first arrow which leaves us with 2 shapes that look like the `<>` triangular brackets.

### The Circle:
The circle is just a circle... Incredible!!

## The construction:
The 2 `arrows` are stacked on top of each other to make a lightninging like shape `right arrow` above and `left arrow` below.
```image

plain: true

```
The `circle` is placed touching the right border of the logo and centered to the `left arrow` at the bottom.
```image
src: "svg/construction-final.svg"
plain: true
span: 2
```
```hint|directive
The `circle` radius is always 1/8 of the mark height, and 1/3.5 of the width.
```
and here is the final result... 

```image
src: "svg/mark-black.svg"
plain: true
span: 2
```

Cool! with some coloring it becomes even cooler.

```image
src: "svg/mark.svg"
plain: true
span: 2
```
```hint|warning
span: 6

**warning:** don't use the colored version unless the logo is displayed in suffecient size. otherwize please use the monochrmoe version or fill it with `JMG Deep Blue` to make it readable and recognizable.
