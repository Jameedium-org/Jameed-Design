# Jameedium:

The Logo typography is custom made with sharp edges to relate to the logo. the sizing is kept constant as possible.

```image
src: "svg/typo-guides.svg"
plain: true
span: 6
```

with the use of dots that look like the video control buttons, because we describe stuff with visuals.

```image
src: "svg/video-controls-black.svg"
plain: true
span: 6
```

with color it's way cooler.

```image
src: "svg/video-controls.svg"
plain: true
span: 6
```

and finally everything together with coloring.

```image
src: "svg/typo.svg"
plain: true
span: 6
```

```hint|warning
span: 6
---
**warning:** don't use the colored version unless the typography is displayed in suffecient size. otherwize please use the monochrmoe version or fill it with `JMG Deep Blue` to make it readable and recognizable.
```

# Slogan:

The slogan is built with same standards as the JameediumÂ© text.

```image
src: "svg/slogan-black.svg"
plain: true
span: 6
```

if the slogan is used in spaces big enough it is colored as follow.

```image

```

```hint|warning
