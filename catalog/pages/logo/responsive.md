# The responsive design:

The JameediumÂ© brand mark and the custom typography are made to be combined in a responsive fashion according to the type of available space.

## The mark with Typography and slogan (wide):

This version of the logo is the most powerful and engaging but should be treated gently.

### colored:

This version of the logo is the most powerful and engaging...**But** `with great power comes great responsibility`. and it could be colored in different ways.

#### fully colored:

this version should only be used on big bold posters or prints.In videos and pictures it should be big enough to tell the difference between all the elements and have appropriate margin around it.

```hint|directive
It's adviced to not use this version unless there is a need for it.
